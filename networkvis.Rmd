Network of coins and mints
==================

This visualisation presents the coin finds in 5 archaeological sites in Northen Israel. Yellow nodes represent mints where coins were made, gray nodes represent some of the 5 sites where the coins were found, but none were minted, and red nodes represent sites that both are a location of finds and had a mint. Hovering over each node will tell the name of the city.

```{r, map}

library(visNetwork)

nodes <- read_csv("nodes.csv")
